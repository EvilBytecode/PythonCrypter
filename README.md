Python Script Crypter
=====================

Description
-----------

- This Python script crypter provides a way to obfuscate your Python scripts, making them undetected from File Scanners like VirusTotal. The tool encodes the script using base64, ensuring an additional layer of security. The generated script remains executable and can be decoded dynamically during execution.

### How to Execute

To use the script, execute the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File .\crypt.ps1 -path "Python File Path Here"
```

> [!TIP]
>  Replace "Python File Path Here" with the actual path to your Python script.

> [!CAUTION]
 Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to execute PowerShell scripts, and the execution policy allows script execution.

> [!NOTE]  
This tool is intended for educational and research purposes. Use responsibly and respect ethical considerations.
